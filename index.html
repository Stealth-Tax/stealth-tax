                        Viewing prices as costs, or opportunity costs, is instructive. Prices convey in a single number the information about scarcity required to coordinate supply and demand. If war breaks out in an oil producing nation, the oil price is likely to go up. Nobody has to know that war has broken out in order to get the information that the oil supply has been harmed. The same dynamic works for changes in demand.

                        A farmer can plant seeds and wait for the harvest, investing time and effort along the way to ensure the crops grow. The yield is the amount of crop the farmer ends up with, which he can sell. He will also have seeds for next season to continue the business. Alternatively, the farmer could avoid all the effort and sell the seeds immediately, to have money right away. But this strategy is unlikely to be conducive to carrying on in the business of farming. In this analogy, seeds are the farmer’s capital. His labour, land, tractor and tools are also capital.

                        Fiat is money by decree, or government money. Its value proposition comes solely from the fact that the government mandates its use. It has no intrinsic worth, and importantly, it is a liability of the state. Its value relative to other currencies relies on the credibility of the treasury (to keep a manageable deficit) and central bank (to effectively ‘control’ short term interest rates and monetary inflation). Monetary inflation was largely created by commercial banks when they extend loans, though since 2020 the main driver of monetary inflation has been government spending funded by the central bank issuing new liabilities to the banking system. This is the government extracting seigniorage; that which mandates the money can pay itself by creating more, devaluing money already in existence.

                        To the extent that fiat is legal tender within the state, it is a claim on wealth within the state’s borders. By adding more money without producing any more wealth, the wealth in existence increases in nominal terms. This is one of the reasons why house prices have seen such extraordinary gains in nominal money terms despite the real value of a house not changing markedly -  they are an ‘inflation hedge’.

                        By providing a product that others value and are willing to pay for above your cost of producing the product, you will create a profitable business. Your earnings from this endeavour are ‘wealth creation’ and your behaviour is productive. You are adding to growth in the economy. Contrast this to the state ‘printing’ money. No wealth is created. In fact, it is destroyed by inflation. The government and its favoured parties benefit through rent seeking; a larger piece of a pie that has not grown.

                        Empirically, more innovation happens with less regulation and freer markets. This is no surprise given it relies on competition, the profit motive, an environment conducive to experimentation, and open to failure. Governments do not face the incentives of the private market, never face the market test, and are heavily bureaucratic. Spending by government only serves to distort markets as they bid for labour and capital in competition with the private sector. Central banks happy to inflate the money supply also create perverse incentives. They create a measurement problem for would-be entrepreneurs by denaturing the measuring stick of fiat money. They also incentivise rent seeking behaviour, such as lobbying for regulation to stifle competition, or extracting tribute from politically unpopular companies to darlings of the time (see carbon credits).

                        We do not need an expanding money supply. It is a fallacy to think central bankers can shepherd an economy in a welfare maximising way. Targeting an arbitrary consumer price inflation index has caused distortions throughout the economy and, as often the case with unseen costs, the opportunity cost of such a system has been so great it is seldom even considered. To optimise incentives towards improvements in quality of life for all, we need a fixed money supply. Considering the industrial revolution happened under a near-fixed money standard, innovation under a fixed supply money would be an exciting prospect.

                        Of course, there are many who enjoy profitable positions in the current system. It is convenient for a government to be able to spend without recourse. Those who can lobby and influence policy, have access to central bankers, ‘win’ government contracts, have state mandated monopolies… have a stake in the continuation of fiat, and unfortunately wield a lot of power.

                        As currencies are traded relative to each other, this is a common excuse for government recklessness. In reality, all reckless nations are taking part in capital destruction. Using the example above, they are selling their seeds for an increasingly worthless currency. Clearly, it is possible for all nations to destroy their capital stock simultaneously. Though ‘yields’ will be unchanged relative to other nations, absolute yields are being destroyed by capital destruction. Though politicians and their fans can spin it whichever way suits their re-election campaign, this is doing unspeakable damage to the quality of life we can expect in the future.

                        Rather than relying on a debt-based currency that has to be devalued by design (and its self-interested patrons in government), you can hold your money balances in an asset that cannot be inflated. Bitcoin has a fixed supply, relies on no third parties, is immutable, cannot have its monetary policy altered, and most importantly, it works. No government or special interest can stop it. Criticisms of price volatility (in fiat currency terms) are old paradigm. As more users join the network and more people wish to transact in Bitcoin, a new economy aside from fiat will emerge. The potential of this new economy will be too great to ignore, and the superior money will become more valuable in real terms.
